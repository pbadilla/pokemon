Pokemon First GEN  v.1.0.0

# Pokemon First GEN list and detail

List of Pokemons with "Load More" button to load more items into grid of Pokemons.

When you click into a Pokemon's card is visualized some properties for this Pokemon a part.

There's a simple search input and a "dark mode" button.

## Install

- Clone this repo.

### Command

- `npm install` o `yarn install`. Install all dependencies.
- `npm start` o `yarn start`. Start project on port 3000 (`http://localhost:3000`) that redirects to `http://localhost:3000/pokemon`.
- `npm test` o `yarn test`: Start tests.

## IMPROVEMENTS

- "dark mode" is not working form some TS aspects that I could not resolve yet.
- Tests not working because I don't know yet, how to implement "alias" to solve imports on compopnents.
